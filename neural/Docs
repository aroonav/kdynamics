Requirement - To build a 3 layer feed-forward network using backproagation algorithm.

Architecture of the system-
	1. Input Layer - 6 nodes/10 nodes*
	2. Hidden Layer - 4 nodes
	3. Output Layer - 1 node


Input will be the feature vector i.e. the time delay between pressing consequtive characters in the password.
Initially, only the Down-Down Time between two consequtive keys are being considered.   

Password - 
	".tie5Roanl"
	There are 11 characters (including the Return key after the end of the password)
	Thus the input vector will contain 10 values of inter-key delays.
